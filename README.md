# Pyber_Analysis

## Overview and Objective

The objective of this assignment was to create a chart to visualize data for a ride sharing company, PyBer. The chart breaks down total fares by urban, suburban, and rural cities, across the first financial quarter of 2019. The data was obtained by reading the raw .csv file in Jupyter Notebook and building Pandas DataFrames to organize it.

## Results

Among Urban, Suburban, and Rural cities, ride sharing in Urban areas generates the most total fares. There are 2,405 urban drivers, far more proportionately than suburban (490 drivers) and rural (78 drivers) combined. This makes urban drivers by far the largest contributors to Pyber's revenue stream by total fares generated. This is to be expected, as urban areas service the most people and many people in urban areas rely on public transit or ride sharing for transportation. Urban areas also made up the largest volume of total rides by proportion at 1,625 vs. 625 total rides for suburban areas and 125 total rides for rural.

However, judging by the chart, it looks like ride sharing activity in suburban areas has grown since April, especially relative to growth in urban and rural areas comparitively when we look at it in the same time frame. An industry-wide bump like the one seen just before march that affects all areas looks different than what is occuring at the end of the graph in April, where total fares in suburban areas are taking off despite growth everywhere else.

## Summary
Judging by the data I would make 3 reccomendations to the CEO:

* invest more in ride sharing infrastructure for suburban areas, hire more drivers, because it has the highest likelyhood to grow in the coming months.

* lowering (subsidizing) the average cost of rural rides may enourage more rural riders to use PyBer more, as currently the cost may outweigh the benefit.

* raising average fare costs slightly for urban areas may offset #2 and because we can.
